# katachi [WIP!]

`katachi` is a small python 3 module that provides functions for converting fluorescence microscopy images into point clouds (using a method called ISLA) and then performing feature embedding (using a method called CBE) to extract a small but expressive set of numerical features that encode the fluorescence distribution of the original image .

This repo will host a simplified python 3 port of the original code written for the paper that first introduced ISLA-CBE; "An Image-Based Data-Driven Analysis of Cellular Architecture in a Developing Tissue" [Hartmann et al., 2020] ([published in eLife](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55913)). The implementation here will be geared toward **reuse** for other projects. If you are looking for the repository that ensures **reproducibility** of the paper's results, see [here](https://github.com/WhoIsJack/data-driven-analysis-lateralline).

*Current ETA for the port: Spring 2021 (appologies for pushing this back repeatedly; it will definitely get done but more urgent things have taken priority)*
